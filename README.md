# JupyterCheat-Sheets

This is just a collection of notes and examples in Jupyter notebooks that I want to share between work and home.
It also gives me something to put in my first github repository to learn the workflow.

Not much to see here, but I'm happy to share.
I've tried to give credit and cite the original sources where I could.
